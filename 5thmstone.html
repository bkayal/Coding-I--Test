                <li><p>Ransomware is a type of malware that takes control of your computer and typically demands a ransom, hence the name- ransomware. The ransom is usually demanded in untraceable currency, like bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. This ransomware named <i>WannaCry</i>, which popped up in 2017, was devastating, as it affected computer systems in the UK, US, Russia, and China. It is reported that the ransomware affected hospitals, warehouses, network providers like AT&T and Verizon, and even banks. Users struggled to find solutions for removal and protection for the ransomware.</p></li>
                <li><p><i>WannaCry</i> began it's attack in May of 2017, when users first began seeing the image above on their screens, ordering them to pay a $300 ransom in Bitcoin, or lose their files to the encryption forever. This message was displayed to over 200,000 systems and could encrypt up to 179 different types of files. The message was also displayed in 28 languages and seen in over 150 countries. The ransom ware infected systems via worm, a type of malware not typically seen with this threat level. By the mid 2000s, worms were not seen anymore as newer and more efficient types of malware were discovered. <i>WannaCry</i> spread through networks automatically, meaning users didn't need to click on a link or be targeted, it was all random. The Windows SMB service was at fault for putting users at risk. The service also had been installed on nearly every version of windows for the last 15 years, meaning nearly every single person who used Windows, was vulnerable to the virus.</p></li>

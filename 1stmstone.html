                <li><p>In the early 1970s, computers were beginning to be seen more and more throughout daily lives. With this growing accessibility also came new dangers. Viruses, or more broadly, malware. Possibly the first known instance of malware is known as the <i>Creeper virus</i> or <i>Creeper Worm</i>. This malware would copy itself to your computer system, and display the message seen above- "IM THE CREEPER. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN!" This message was displayed on several computer users, which was surely a shock to most.
                    It could then move from system to system via the ARPANET (a rudimentary form of the much larger internet we know today), something its creator, Bob Thomas had access to. Later, Bob would create an anti-virus known as Reaper, which would dismantle Creeper in order to rid the ARPANET of the original virus. <p>Not long after, a similar program called <i>Wabbit</i> emerged. <i>Wabbit</i> like <i>Creeper</i>, was a program with the ability to duplicate itself. Each rabbit program would double, creating copies, which would begin using up the computers resources/hardware. Its nickname, <i>Wabbit</i> was given after the speed at which it replicated became notorious. Bob simply wanted to create a program that was self replicating, and unwittingly gave birth to one of the worst internet phenomena we know today. The modern virus can be found throughout the internet, and is far more detrimental to computer health and your personal well being. Viruses can infect your computer extremely quickly if you're not careful, and personal information like contacts, credit card inofrmation, and addresses are all vulnerable to viruses as well as malware.</p></li>

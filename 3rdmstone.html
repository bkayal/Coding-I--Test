                <li><p>The <i>Michelangelo Virus</i> gets its name from the date it was supposedly programmed to erase data from hard drives, March 6th, the birthday of Michelangelo. Its discovery in 1991 gave details concerning its purpose and programming, it would infect DOS systems like the boot sector of floppy disks and the master boot record of the hard disk. Later on the media informed the public that the virus would activate on March 6th and its infamy sored. John McAfee, founder of the antivirus company McAfee, estimated that the <i>Michelangelo Virus</i> possibly infected 5 million computers. The abilities of the virus itself include its "time-bomb" function, a way to determine when the virus would activate. The virus itself could destroy data on whatever boot-disk it was located, rendering the data unrecoverable as the disk would no longer function.</p></li>
                <li><p>The <i>Michelangelo Virus'</i> impact is significant and has had lasting effects, even today. The <i>Michelangelo Virus</i> is the first virus to garner mass attention, and scared millions as malware awareness was not common. Media fear-mongering is attributed to an increase in anti-virus program sales, and cemented a fear for viruses that lasts in the public today. However, computer safety is fairly well practiced, as computer literacy and internet security is more common. Users nowadays understand how viruses can infect your computer, and anti-virus software is more accessible and cheaper, with more options to choose from, such as Norton, and AVG. The <i>Michelangelo Virus</i>, to this day, activates every March 6th on infected computers, but isn't dangerous, as whatever computer its activates on is subsequently unable to spread the virus.</p></li>

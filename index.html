                <li><p>In the early 1970s, computers were beginning to be seen more and more throughout daily lives. With this growing accessibility also came new dangers. Viruses, or more broadly, malware. Possibly the first known instance of malware is known as the <i>Creeper virus</i> or <i>Creeper Worm</i>. This malware would copy itself to your computer system, and display the message seen above- "IM THE CREEPER. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN!" This message was displayed on several computer users, which was surely a shock to most.
                    It could then move from system to system via the ARPANET (a rudimentary form of the much larger internet we know today), something its creator, Bob Thomas had access to. Later, Bob would create an anti-virus known as Reaper, which would dismantle Creeper in order to rid the ARPANET of the original virus. <p>Not long after, a similar program called <i>Wabbit</i> emerged. <i>Wabbit</i> like <i>Creeper</i>, was a program with the ability to duplicate itself. Each rabbit program would double, creating copies, which would begin using up the computers resources/hardware. Its nickname, <i>Wabbit</i> was given after the speed at which it replicated became notorious. Bob simply wanted to create a program that was self replicating, and unwittingly gave birth to one of the worst internet phenomena we know today. The modern virus can be found throughout the internet, and is far more detrimental to computer health and your personal well being. Viruses can infect your computer extremely quickly if you're not careful, and personal information like contacts, credit card inofrmation, and addresses are all vulnerable to viruses as well as malware.</p></li>

            <ul>
                <br>
     <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Elk-Cloner"><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.oRP6Xvf8MbzZ7O0YpoLhhgHaEH?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" class="png" height="200px"></a> <p class=source>GyroxOpex. 2019. Elk Cloner Error. Accessed 2022.</p>
                <li><p>Elk Cloner was created by a 15 year old in 1982, and is widely regarded as the first computere virus to spread in mass scale on personal computers. Now, average users of a personal computer would recieve a message every 50th time they booted up their computer, shown in the image above it reads-"Elk Cloner:  The program with a personality It will get on all you disks It will infiltrate your chips Yes it's Cloner! It will stick to you like glue It will modify ram too Send in the Cloner!</p></li>
                <li><p>Elk Cloner's purpose was not for malicoious intentions (however it did have side effects), but rather more as a prank and a way for Richard Skrenta to show off: the 15 year old who developed the virus. Skrenta programmed the virus to interface with the Apple II operating system. Essentially, the virus would generate a copy from an infected floppy disc anytime an uninfected floppy disc was deteced on a the operating system and was booted up. The way this virus replicated was largely influenced by human interaction, as a physical object: a floppy disk, was needed for the virus to spread.</p></li>
                <li><p>Some side effects of the Elk Cloner were error behaviors that occured on specific boots, in the 10th, 15th, 25th, 40th, 65th, and 75th boot, flashing or inverted text, entering of the monitoring program, and hanging of the system could all occur. These issues could be resovled after a reboot, as Elk Cloner would recognize the computer had booted again thus returning it to its dormant behavior.</p></li>

    <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/the-michelangelo-virus-25-years-later"><img src="https://icdn.dtcn.com/image/digitaltrends_es/24-virus-michel-768x512.jpg" class=png height="200px"></a> <p class="source">Allan Velez. 2021. Michelangelo Infographic. Accessed 2022.</p>
                <li><p>The <i>Michelangelo Virus</i> gets its name from the date it was supposedly programmed to erase data from hard drives, March 6th, the birthday of Michelangelo. Its discovery in 1991 gave details concerning its purpose and programming, it would infect DOS systems like the boot sector of floppy disks and the master boot record of the hard disk. Later on the media informed the public that the virus would activate on March 6th and its infamy sored. John McAfee, founder of the antivirus company McAfee, estimated that the <i>Michelangelo Virus</i> possibly infected 5 million computers. The abilities of the virus itself include its "time-bomb" function, a way to determine when the virus would activate. The virus itself could destroy data on whatever boot-disk it was located, rendering the data unrecoverable as the disk would no longer function.</p></li>
                <li><p>The <i>Michelangelo Virus'</i> impact is significant and has had lasting effects, even today. The <i>Michelangelo Virus</i> is the first virus to garner mass attention, and scared millions as malware awareness was not common. Media fear-mongering is attributed to an increase in anti-virus program sales, and cemented a fear for viruses that lasts in the public today. However, computer safety is fairly well practiced, as computer literacy and internet security is more common. Users nowadays understand how viruses can infect your computer, and anti-virus software is more accessible and cheaper, with more options to choose from, such as Norton, and AVG. The <i>Michelangelo Virus</i>, to this day, activates every March 6th on infected computers, but isn't dangerous, as whatever computer its activates on is subsequently unable to spread the virus.</p></li>

            <ul>
                <br>
    <a href="https://www.caida.org/catalog/papers/2003_sapphire/"><img src="https://www.caida.org/catalog/papers/2003_sapphire/sql-after-small.gif" class=png height="200px"></a> <p class="source">Caida.org. 2003. Geographic Map of Sapphire Hosts. Accessed 2022. https://caida.org</p>
                <li><p>The <i>Slammer or Sapphire Worm</i> slowed the internet to a standstill in 2003. The worm set a record for its speed of infection, as the total number of infected hosts would double every 8.5 seconds. The worm was first made known on January 25th. The worm would exploit an overflow vulnerability in computers that used Microsoft's SQL server or MSDE 2000, another version of the Microsoft SQL server. The vulnerability could be fixed with a patch that Microsoft released before July of 2002, when the vulnerability was announced. However, not everyone installed the patch, which made their systems vulnerable. The <i>Slammer Worm</i> infected computers based on random scanning: selecting IP addresses to infect, the worm could find all vulnerable systems and hosts relatively quickly. It's rate of infection is similar to an exponential growth graph. The infections per hour rose quickly and continued to rise through the days to come. </p></li>
                <li><p>The United states contained the largest number of victims of the virus, who's total number of infected computers is low-balled around 75,000. Most machines would be infected within 10 minutes of the virus' release. <i>Sapphire</i> did not contain any sort of harmful payload, but its mere existence caused extensive strain to networks and internet providers. The speed of it's infection may have something to do with it's lack of payload. With a scanner packet size of only 376 bytes, not kilobytes, <i>Sapphire</i> was set apart from other worms like Code Red which contained scanner packets in the kilobytes, not bytes.</p></li>

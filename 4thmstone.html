                <li><p>The <i>Slammer or Sapphire Worm</i> slowed the internet to a standstill in 2003. The worm set a record for its speed of infection, as the total number of infected hosts would double every 8.5 seconds. The worm was first made known on January 25th. The worm would exploit an overflow vulnerability in computers that used Microsoft's SQL server or MSDE 2000, another version of the Microsoft SQL server. The vulnerability could be fixed with a patch that Microsoft released before July of 2002, when the vulnerability was announced. However, not everyone installed the patch, which made their systems vulnerable. The <i>Slammer Worm</i> infected computers based on random scanning: selecting IP addresses to infect, the worm could find all vulnerable systems and hosts relatively quickly. It's rate of infection is similar to an exponential growth graph. The infections per hour rose quickly and continued to rise through the days to come. </p></li>
                <li><p>The United states contained the largest number of victims of the virus, who's total number of infected computers is low-balled around 75,000. Most machines would be infected within 10 minutes of the virus' release. <i>Sapphire</i> did not contain any sort of harmful payload, but its mere existence caused extensive strain to networks and internet providers. The speed of it's infection may have something to do with it's lack of payload. With a scanner packet size of only 376 bytes, not kilobytes, <i>Sapphire</i> was set apart from other worms like Code Red which contained scanner packets in the kilobytes, not bytes.</p></li>

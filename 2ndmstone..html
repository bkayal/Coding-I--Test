                <li><p>Elk Cloner was created by a 15 year old in 1982, and is widely regarded as the first computere virus to spread in mass scale on personal computers. Now, average users of a personal computer would recieve a message every 50th time they booted up their computer, shown in the image above it reads-"Elk Cloner:  The program with a personality It will get on all you disks It will infiltrate your chips Yes it's Cloner! It will stick to you like glue It will modify ram too Send in the Cloner!</p></li>
                <li><p>Elk Cloner's purpose was not for malicoious intentions (however it did have side effects), but rather more as a prank and a way for Richard Skrenta to show off: the 15 year old who developed the virus. Skrenta programmed the virus to interface with the Apple II operating system. Essentially, the virus would generate a copy from an infected floppy disc anytime an uninfected floppy disc was deteced on a the operating system and was booted up. The way this virus replicated was largely influenced by human interaction, as a physical object: a floppy disk, was needed for the virus to spread.</p></li>
                <li><p>Some side effects of the Elk Cloner were error behaviors that occured on specific boots, in the 10th, 15th, 25th, 40th, 65th, and 75th boot, flashing or inverted text, entering of the monitoring program, and hanging of the system could all occur. These issues could be resovled after a reboot, as Elk Cloner would recognize the computer had booted again thus returning it to its dormant behavior.</p></li>
